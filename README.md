This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### A Note

I was surprised by the Typescript requirement since it was not in the job offer requirements so I had to scavenge my way through the huge TS documentation and purchased a couple courses to learn the topic quickly. I am way more comfortable using JSX.

As a token of honesty, here are the things I finished

## Things finished

-   Created all the necessary components.
-   Created all the actions and reducers for store management.
-   Created all required Private and Public Routes.
-   Finished The core logic (fetching tasks, deleting a task and adding tasks).
-   Finished unit testing.
-   Finished Styling

### Installation

-   Clone the Repo.
-   Run npm install to install all the required node_modules.
-   Run `npm start` in your terminal to initiate the app.

Not the best thing in the world, but I have done what I could.

Thanks
