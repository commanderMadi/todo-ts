This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## A Note

I was surprised by the Typescript requirement since it was not in the job offer requirements so I had to scavenge my way through the huge TS documentation and purchased a couple courses to learn the topic quickly. I am way more comfortable using JSX.

As a token of honesty, here are the things I finished and the things I need more time to finish (possibly an extra day)

## Things finished

-   Created all the necessary components.
-   Created all the actions and reducers for store management.
-   Routes have been established.
-   The core logic (fetching todos, deleting a todo and adding todo) is complete.
-

## Things remaining to finish

-   Creating private route for profile.
-   Creating a Login form.
-   Styling the App.
-   Testing the App

### Thanks.
